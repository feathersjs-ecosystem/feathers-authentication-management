# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
npm i feathers-authentication-management feathers-mailer
# or
yarn add feathers-authentication-management feathers-mailer
```

## Setup feathers-mailer

See [feathers-mailer](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-mailer)

## Setup application

```js
// src/app.js
const authManagement = require('feathers-authentication-management');
app
  .configure(authentication)
  .configure(authManagement({ options }, { docs }))
```

### Options

- `service: string = '/users'`: The path of the service for user items, e.g. `/users` (default) or `/organization`.
- `path: string = 'authManagement'`: The path to associate with this service`.
  See [Multiple services](#multiple-services) for more information.
- `skipIsVerifiedCheck: boolean = false`: if `false` (default) it is impossible to reset password if email is not verified.
- `sanitizeUserForClient: (user: User) => Partial<User>`: ([default](https://github.com/feathers-plus/feathers-authentication-management/blob/master/src/helpers/sanitize-user-for-client.js)) sanitize the user in the response, if not overwritten **THE USER OBJECT IS IN THE RESPONSE** eg. on a password reset request, to reply with empty object use `sanitizeUserForClient: () => ({})`
- `notifier: (type: string, user: User, notifierOptions) => Promise<void>` returns a Promise.
  - type: type of notification
    - `'resendVerifySignup'` From resendVerifySignup API call
    - `'verifySignup'` From verifySignupLong and verifySignupShort API calls
    - `'verifySignupSetPassword'` From verifySignupSetPasswordLong and verifySignupSetPasswordShort API calls
    - `'sendResetPwd'` From sendResetPwd API call
    - `'resetPwd'` From resetPwdLong and resetPwdShort API calls
    - `'passwordChange'` From passwordChange API call
    - `'identityChange'` From identityChange API call
  - `user`: user's item, minus password.
  - `notifierOptions`: notifierOptions option from resendVerifySignup and sendResetPwd API calls
- `longTokenLen: number = 15`: Half the length of the long token. Default is 15, giving 30-char tokens.
- `shortTokenLen: number = 6`: Length of short token.
- `shortTokenDigits: boolean = true`: Short token is digits if true, else alphanumeric.
- `delay: number = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 5`: Duration for sign up email verification token in ms. Default is 5 days.
- `resetDelay: number = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 2`: Duration for password reset token in ms. Default is 2 hours.
- `resetAttempts: number = 0`: Amount of times a user can submit an invalid token before the current token gets removed from the database. Default is 0.
- `reuseResetToken: boolean = false`: Use the same reset token if the user resets password twice in a short period. In this case token is not hashed in the database. Default is false.
- `identifyUserProps: string[] = ['email']`: Prop names in `user` item which uniquely identify the user,
  e.g. `['username', 'email', 'cellphone']`.
  The default is `['email']`.
  The prop values must be strings.
  Only these props may be changed with verification by the service.
  At least one of these props must be provided whenever a short token is used,
  as the short token alone is too susceptible to brute force attack.
- `passwordField: string = 'password'`: Prop name of the password field.
- `useSeparateServices: boolean | Record<action, string> = true`: Registers the following services which are also accessible on the client:
  - `checkUnique`: `${path}/check-unique'`
  - `identityChange`: `${path}/identity-change`,
  - `passwordChange`: `${path}/password-change`,
  - `resendVerifySignup`: `${path}/resend-verify-signup`,
  - `resetPwdLong`: `${path}/reset-password-long`,
  - `resetPwdShort`: `${path}/reset-password-short`,
  - `sendResetPwd`: `${path}/send-reset-pwd`,
  - `verifySignupLong`: `${path}/verify-signup-long`,
  - `verifySignupSetPasswordLong`: `${path}/verify-signup-set-password-long`,
  - `verifySignupSetPasswordShort`: `${path}/verify-signup-set-password-short`,
  - `verifySignupShort`: `${path}/verify-signup-short`

`docs` (optional) are:

- representation of the service swagger documentation. Default `{}`

### Create notifier function

```js
// src/services/auth-management/notifier.js

module.exports = function(app) {
  function getLink(type, hash) {
    const url = 'http://localhost:3030/' + type + '?token=' + hash; // your domain url
    return url;
  }

  function sendEmail(email) {
    return app.service('mailer').create(email).then(function (result) {
      console.log('Sent email', result)
    }).catch(err => {
      console.log('Error sending email', err)
    })
  }

  return {
    // see options.notifier
    notifier: function(type, user, notifierOptions) {
      let tokenLink
      let email
      switch (type) {
        case 'resendVerifySignup': //sending the user the verification email
          tokenLink = getLink('verify', user.verifyToken)
          email = {
             from: process.env.FROM_EMAIL,
             to: user.email,
             subject: 'Verify Signup',
             html: tokenLink
          }
          return sendEmail(email)
          break

        case 'verifySignup': // confirming verification
          tokenLink = getLink('verify', user.verifyToken)
          email = {
             from: process.env.FROM_EMAIL,
             to: user.email,
             subject: 'Confirm Signup',
             html: 'Thanks for verifying your email'
          }
          return sendEmail(email)
          break

        case 'sendResetPwd':
          tokenLink = getLink('reset', user.resetToken)
          email = {}
          return sendEmail(email)
          break

        case 'resetPwd':
          tokenLink = getLink('reset', user.resetToken)
          email = {}
          return sendEmail(email)
          break

        case 'passwordChange':
          email = {}
          return sendEmail(email)
          break

        case 'identityChange':
          tokenLink = getLink('verifyChanges', user.verifyToken)
          email = {}
          return sendEmail(email)
          break

        default:
          break
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- The `getLink` function generates our token url. This can either have a verify token or a reset token included. For now, we are only using the verify token.
- The `sendEmail` function calls our `/mailer` service internally to send the email.
- The notifier function, based on the action type, decides what email to send where. We are now only using the verification part but this can also be used to code the other actions. Also, we will only be sending the plain link to the email. If you want to use html templates or some preprocessor to generate nicer looking emails, you need to make sure they are inserted as a value in the html key in the email object.

### Add properties to your `/users` service

The service creates and maintains the following properties in the `user` item:

- `isVerified: boolean`: If the user's email addr has been verified
- `verifyToken: string`: The 30-char token generated for email addr verification
- `verifyShortToken: string`: The 6-digit token generated for cellphone addr verification
- `verifyExpires: Date|number`: When the email addr token expire
- `verifyChanges: string[]`: New values to apply on verification to some identifyUserProps
- `resetToken: string`: The 30-char token generated for forgotten password reset
- `resetShortToken: string`: The 6-digit token generated for forgotten password reset
- `resetExpires: Date|number`: When the forgotten password token expire
- `resetAttempts: number`: Amount of incorrect reset submissions left before token invalidation

The following user item might also contain the following props:

- `preferredComm`: The preferred way to notify the user. One of `options.identifyUserProps`.

The `/users` service is expected to be already configured.
Its `patch` method is used to update the password when needed,
and this module hashes the password before it is passed to `patch`,
therefore `patch` may _not_ have a `auth.hashPassword()` hook. In cases where you only need hashPassword for externally submitted patch calls, you may use `iff(isProvider('external'), hashPassword())` on the patch hook.

The user must be signed in before being allowed to change their password or communication values.
The service, for feathers-authenticate v1.x, requires hooks similar to:

```javascript
// src/services/auth-management/auth-management.hooks.js
const { authenticate } = require("@feathersjs/authentication").hooks;
const { iff } = require('feathers-hooks-common');

const isAction = (...args) => (hook) => args.includes(hook.data.action);
app.service("authManagement").before({
  create: [
    iff(
      isAction("passwordChange", "identityChange"),
      authenticate("jwt")
    ),
  ],
});
```

### Setting up authentication management hooks

Now we are ready to set up some hooks to actually get our service to work. For this we need to adapt the `users.hooks.js` file. We need to do a couple of things here.

- Import the verification hooks from feathers authentication management by adding this line to the top: `const { addVerification, removeVerification } = require(‘feathers-authentication-management’).hooks;`
- Import our `notifier` by adding this line: `const accountService = require(‘../authmanagement/notifier’);`
- Then add `addVerification()` to the before create hook to add verification to our user object. This needs to be after the `hashPassword()` hook. What this code does is that it adds some extra fields to our user objects and generates a token.
- Finally, we need to add two after create hooks to our `/users` service. One to call our notifier function and one to remove the verification again. That looks like this:

For a full example, see [Hooks](/hooks.html)

### Verifying the email link

For simplicity we will create a basic html page with a `XMLHttpRequest()` script to handle the verification. Obviously there are better ways to handle this with feathers-client and your favorite frontend library. However, that is out of scope of this article. Following the structure of our verification link we will create a new folder in the `/public` folder of our app called “verify”. Here we will put a new `index.html` file. All this needs to do is to send a POST request to our `/authmanagement` service with the following JSON object.

```json
{
  "action": "verifySignupLong",
  "value": YOUR_TOKEN
}
```

So in the end all we need to do is create a script that takes the `token` parameter from the URL and posts this to our endpoint. You can create a sample page which looks like this.

### Securing the application

Now that the app works there is only one step to complete and that is adding some security to the users service. Since we have a nice authentication flow running we don’t want any users to meddle with the user service directly anymore. For this we create two before hooks. One on the update method and one on the patch method. With the one on the update method we are going to disallow this method in its entirety. After all, we wouldn’t want someone to be able to replace our carefully verified user by a new one. The one on the patch method we want to restrict the user from touching any of the authentication field methods directly. For a full example of the `services/users/users.hooks.js` file see: [Hooks](/hooks.md)
